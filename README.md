# ASTROMICIO's ADVENTURES

Astromicio and their friends are on a secret mission, traveling towards the Cloud Galaxy. During their journey, while crossing the Ita-Galaxy, a spaceship malfunction causes havoc: the space crew is teleported on different planets and Astromicio remains the only one on board. After a crash landing, our main character is found on planet Earth by Bob, a friendly robot living there. Astromicio uses sign language to communicate with Bob, who is fluent in many languages and offers to help them find their friends and learn the Italian language. The player is asked to help Astromicio as well: in order to collect the diamonds, essential to fix the broken spaceship, children must assist the main character in recognizing hard and soft sounds.
